        <p>
            Since the {{ config('app.name') }} Network's core focus is on mass user adoption, it is ideal to make a deep dive into the technical
            architecture from where the user should start a journey. Our investment packages range from basic to compound
            investment packages to suit your income. We automate arbitrages, provide exchanges with liquidity both CEX and DEX
            incentivize liquidity providers (LP) to stake or lock up their crypto assets in a smart contract-based liquidity
            pool. These incentives can be a percentage of transaction fees, interest from lenders or a governance token (see
            liquidity mining below). These returns are expressed as a return of interest (ROI). As more investors add funds to
            the related liquidity pool, the value of the issued returns rise in value. other services. Investments can also be
            made in cryptocurrencies, which include: Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT. Immediately you execute account funding we

        <h2>{{ config('app.name') }} AS A PROTOCOL</h2>
        <p>
            {{ config('app.name') }} is a protocol, launched September 2014. Because of its nature, it will exist for as long as the crypto space
            does. Designed with simplicity in mind, the protocol provides an interface for seamless exchange of cross chain
            asset/tokens. By eliminating unnecessary forms of rent extraction and middlemen it allows faster, more efficient
            exchange. Where it makes tradeoffs, decentralization, censorship resistance, and security are prioritized.
            There is no central token. No special treatment is given to early investors, adopters, or developers. Asset/Token
            listing/trade activity is arbitraged throughout data interaction with data oracle servers that provides the best
            market rate for users. All smart contract functions are public and all upgrades are opt-in.
            This site will serve as a project overview for - explaining how it works, how to use it, and how to build on top of
            it. These docs are actively being worked on and more information will be added on an ongoing basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            We achieve extremely efficient trades by implementing the swap invariant, which has significantly lower slippage for
            stablecoin trades than many other prominent invariants (e.g., constant-product). Note that in this context allows
            stablecoins which refers to tokens that are stable representations of one another. This includes, for example, USD-
            pegged stablecoins (like DAI and USDC), but also ETH and sETH (synthetic ETH) or different versions of wrapped BTC.
            For a detailed overview of the StableSwap invariant design, please read the official StableSwap whitepaper.
            We allow staking which creates a pool which is essentially a smart contract that implements the swap invariant and
            therefore contains the logic for exchanging stable tokens. However, while the pool implement the swap invariant,
            they may come in different pool flavors.
            In its simplest form, a pool is an implementation of the swap invariant with 2 or more tokens, which can be referred
            to as a plain pool. Alternative and more complex pool flavors include pools with lending functionality, so-called
            lending pools, as well as metapools, which are pools that allow for the exchange of one or more tokens with the
            tokens of one or more underlying base pools. These pool interaction are done by our chain connection with a wide
            variety of trusted pools in the space from on chain to off chain. CEXS to DEXS
        </p>
        
        <h4>Collateral Assets</h4>
        <p>
            ie off chain assets like the stock asset backed token. These are generated, backed, and kept stable through
            collateral assets that are deposited into vaults on the Protocol. A collateral asset is a digital asset that holders
            have voted to accept into the Protocol.
            To generate, the Protocol accepts as collateral any asset that has been approved by {{ config('app.name') }} holders.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The oracle is in charge of determining price feeds and lending/borrowing rates etc.
            {{ config('app.name') }} TOKEN: By so doing assets are minted into the network by users providing collateral to stake with the {{ config('app.name') }} token
            to create a vault that gives asset minting possibilities for interested parties. These vaults are governed by each
            individual staking and have their community for retrieval or related activity ie liquidation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We use LINK as our oracle service, ChainLink nodes return replies to data requests or queries made by or on behalf
            of a user contract, which we refer to as requesting contracts and denote by USER-SC. ChainLink’s on-chain interface
            to requesting contracts is itself an on-chain contract that we denote by CHAINLINK-SC.
        </p>
        
        <p>Behind CHAINLINK-SC, ChainLink has an on-chain component consisting of three main contracts: a reputation contract,
            an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The reputation contract keeps track of
            oracle-service-provider performance metrics. The order-matching smart contract takes a proposed service level
            agreement, logs the SLA parameters, and collects bids from oracle providers. It then selects bids using the
            reputation contract and finalizes the oracle SLA. The aggregating contract collects the oracle providers’ responses
            and calculates the final collective result of the ChainLink query. It also feeds oracle provider metrics back into
            the reputation contract. ChainLink contracts are designed in a modular manner, allowing for them to be configured or
            replaced by users as needed. The on-chain work flow has three steps: 1) oracle selection, 2) data reporting, 3)
            result aggregation.</p>
        <p>Oracle Selection An oracle services purchaser specifies requirements that make up a service level agreement (SLA)
            proposal. The SLA proposal includes details such as query parameters and the number of oracles needed by the
            purchaser. Additionally, the purchaser specifies the reputation and aggregating contracts to be used for the rest of
            the agreement.
            Using the reputation maintained on-chain, along with a more robust set of data gathered from logs of past contracts,
            purchasers can manually sort, filter, and select oracles via off-chain listing services. Our intention is for
            ChainLink to maintain one such listing service, collecting all ChainLink-related logs and verifying the binaries of
            listed oracle contracts. The data used to generate listings will be pulled from the blockchain, allowing for
            alternative oracle-listing services to be built. Purchasers will submit SLA proposals to oracles off-chain, and come
            to agreement before finalizing the SLA on-chain.</p>
        <p>Manual matching is not possible for all situations. For example, a contract may need to request oracle services
            dynamically in response to its load. Automated solu- tions solve this problem and enhance usability. For these
            reasons, automated oracle matching is also being proposed by ChainLink through the use of order-matching contracts.
        </p>
        <p>Once the purchaser has specified their SLA proposal, instead of contacting the ora- cles directly, they will submit
            the SLA to an order-matching contract. The submission of the proposal to the order-matching contract triggers a log
            that oracle providers can monitor and filter based on their capabilities and service objectives. ChainLink nodes
            then choose whether to bid on the proposal or not, with the contract only accepting bids from nodes that meet the
            SLA’s requirements. When an oracle service provider bids on a contract, they commit to it, specifically by attaching
            the penalty amount that would be lost due to their misbehavior, as defined in the SLA.</p>
        <p>Bids are accepted for the entirety of the bidding window. Once the SLA has received enough qualified bids and the
            bidding window has ended, the requested number of oracles is selected from the pool of bids. Penalty payments that
            were offered during the bidding process are returned to oracles who were not selected, and a finalized SLA record is
            created. When the finalized SLA is recorded it triggers a log notifying the selected oracles. The oracles then
            perform the assignment detailed by the SLA.</p>
        
        <p>Data Reporting Once the new oracle record has been created, the off-chain oracles execute the agreement and report
            back on-chain. For more detail about off-chain interactions</p>
